# Broken
Due to the new api update, https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/revision_history, it broke watch later, and watch history, so I cannot check what is the newest video for each playlist. Need a work around this
## Work around
You will need to create a playlist call ".WatchLater" and add a video to it as a starting point to add video to your "WatchLater" playlist.
TODO: Update ".WatchLater" playlist when ever you add subsctiption to "WatchLater" playlist
# Youtube-API
The point of this project is to add my subscription video automatically to my watch later.
Using python, and still doing research on it. I have some feature on it that I am not using.
Might expand it according to my needs.

# How to run on Centos
# How to use
```
  Main Menu
  (0) For debugging purposes
  (1) Add new playlist
  (2) Delete a playlist
  (3) List user subscription
  (4) Add subscription video to watch later playlist
  (10/q) Quit
```
The one you want to use is 4, which will add video on your subscription list to watch later playlist
